            The 5G rollout has been far from smooth. Despite its dazzling promises, like <br>
            the advent of self-driving cars and virtual reality, the fifth generation of <br>
            mobile internet is considered a threat by many. On the 14th of July of this <br>
            year, the UK <a href="#">banned 5G kits </a>produced by Chinese manufacturer Huawei due <br>
            to security concerns. Meanwhile, activists are taking issue <a href="#">with the <br>
            environmental cost </a> of the new technology, which will require enormous <br>
            resources just to replace the already-speedy 4G network.<br><br>

            Then, there’s a group of people who oppose 5G because they believe it's a <br>
            health hazard. The theory that mobile phones cause cancer has been around <br>
            for a while, albeit with <a href="#">little scientific basis</a>. In its latest iteration, <br>
            <a href="#">conspiracy theorists</a> say 5G phone towers are weakening our immune systems and <br>
            increasing our vulnerability to <a href="#">COVID-19</a>. Some even believe the towers<br>
            transmit the virus directly to humans – and that naturally the best way to<br> 
            fight the pandemic is to <a href="#">set them</a> on fire.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            This fear of waves might feel very bat-shit 2020, but the phenomenon has been<br>
            around for at least 60 years. Electromagnetic waves, high-voltage lines, <br>
            microwaves, radios, radars, wind turbines and wifi modems: all have been “blamed”<br>
            for causing health problems such as leukaemia, infertility and autism. None of <br>
            these theories have been scientifically confirmed, but a mix of miscommunication, <br>
            poor understanding of science and sheer mysticism has kept them alive.<br><br>


            First of all, it’s important to understand what “waves” are and how they work.<br> 
            The human eye can only capture a <a href="#">minuscule portion</a> of the energy travelling across<br>
            the universe in the form of electromagnetic waves and other types of radiation. <br>
            That tiny range of perception, known as the visible spectrum, is basically what <br>
            we call colours.<br><br>

            Electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength. What we perceive as purple<br>
            travels at a wavelength of about 400 nanometers (nm). Radiation under 400nm is <br>
            known as “ultraviolet” and is invisible to humans. Another type of radiation,<br>
            “ionising radiation”, also travels at a wavelength below 400nm. This radiation<br>
            transforms the atoms it touches into ions by stealing their electrons and <br>
            breaking the chemical bonds of molecules. In short, it is unstable and dangerous<br>
            for humans. For instance, radioactive materials like uranium release ionising <br>
            radiation – which, in extreme amounts, can cause burns and even death.<br><br>

            The panic about electromagnetic radiation started in the 1950s. In the aftermath<br>
            of World War II, an epidemic of so-called “radio wave sickness” struck military<br>
            outposts in Eastern Europe. People said radios and radars were causing symptoms<br>
            like fatigue, headaches, vertigo and trouble sleeping. Today, the condition is<br>
            known as <a href="#">electromagnetic hypersensitivity</a>, but it’s not recognised as a disease <br>
            by medical authorities and is mostly <a href="#">self-diagnosed.</a><br><br>

            In 1979, electromagnetic waves began to be associated with cancer. It all started<br>
            with a <a href="#">scientific article</a> which observed that in Colorado, high voltage lines <br>
            were more often found near the homes of children who developed cancer compared with<br>
            healthy kids. The correlation was researched in many subsequent studies, but to <br>
            this day, <a href="#">no consistent evidence</a> to corroborate the claim has been found.<br><br>

            In the 1980s, when microwaves became a common household appliance, public fear<br>
            of electromagnetic radiation spiked, fuelled by <a href="#">the media</a>. Microwaves were said <br>
            to <a href="#">cause cancer</a> and <a href="#">destroy the nutrients</a> in food. Although current studies show<br>
            that a microwave in good condition poses <a href="#">no health risk</a> to humans, <a href="#">false reports</a><br>
            about the Soviet Union banning microwaves in 1976 keep popping up every now and<br>
            again.<br><br>

            <br>
            Health organisations such as the French Agency for Food, Environmental and<br>
            Occupational Health and Safety say there’s a “possible” link between electromagnetic<br>
            radiation and cancer, especially leukaemia in children. That’s because early studies<br>
            found some correlation, despite the WHO calling the evidence “weak” and <a href="#">their<br>
            methodology</a> being called into question.<br><br>

            As for the long-term effects of electromagnetic radiation, in 2011 the International<br>
            Agency for Research on Cancer classified electromagnetic radiation as  <br>
            <a href="#">“possibly carcinogenic”</a>, but with a huge caveat. They found “limited” evidence <br> 
            connecting the use of mobiles with two specific types of cancer, glioma and acoustic<br>
            neuroma, and “inadequate” evidence for other types. Other common substances like <br>
            <a href="#">pickles and coffee</a> are also considered <a href="#">possibly carcinogenic</a> by the WHO.<br><br>

            Scientific basis for the panic is shaky at best, but that hasn’t stopped people<br>
            freaking out about electromagnetic waves. But if scientists can’t know something<br>
            for sure, non-scientists won’t be able to figure it out either. Technophobia, or<br>
            fear of technology, might just be deeply rooted in the human psyche.<br><br>

            <a href="#">Ian Hacking</a>, a Canadian philosopher of science, studied the phenomenon of “temporary<br> 
            mental illnesses”, or disorders that only appear within certain contexts and then <br>
            disappear. For example, in 16th century Europe, around the time transparent glass became<br>
            common, <a href="#">people were convinced</a> their own bodies had become glass. This “glass delusion”<br>
            affected even King Charles VI of France, who dressed in special reinforced clothing to<br>
            protect his fragile body. Another famously technophobic group was the Luddites – <br>
            English textile workers who destroyed their weaving machines in the 19th century in <br>
            protest against the domination of technology.<br><br>

            Today, the invisible waves that connect us to each other are being seen as a similar<br> 
            threat. And with Big Tech using waves to collect more and more of our personal data, <br>
            people are losing trust and heading down conspiracy rabbit holes. 5G is just the latest<br>
            scapegoat.<br><br>
