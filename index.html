<p>This article originally appeared on VICE France.<br><br>

The 5G rollout has been far from smooth. Despite its dazzling promises, like <br>
 the advent of self-driving cars and virtual reality, the fifth generation of <br>
 mobile internet is considered a threat by many. On the 14th of July of this <br>
 year, the UK banned 5G kits produced by Chinese manufacturer Huawei due <br>
 to security concerns. Meanwhile, activists are taking issue with the <br>
 environmental cost of the new technology, which will require enormous <br>
 resources just to replace the already-speedy 4G network.<br>

Then, there’s a group of people who oppose 5G because they believe it's a <br>
health hazard. The theory that mobile phones cause cancer has been around <br>
for a while, albeit with little scientific basis. In its latest iteration, <br>
conspiracy theorists say 5G phone towers are weakening our immune systems and <br>
increasing our vulnerability to COVID-19. Some even believe the towers<br>
 transmit the virus directly to humans – and that naturally the best way to<br> 
 fight the pandemic is to set them on fire.<br>

Getting to the Bottom of What the 5G Fuss Is All About

This fear of waves might feel very bat-shit 2020, but the phenomenon has been<br>
 around for at least 60 years. Electromagnetic waves, high-voltage lines, <br>
 microwaves, radios, radars, wind turbines and wifi modems: all have been “blamed”<br>
  for causing health problems such as leukaemia, infertility and autism. None of <br>
  these theories have been scientifically confirmed, but a mix of miscommunication, <br>
  poor understanding of science and sheer mysticism has kept them alive.<br><br>


First of all, it’s important to understand what “waves” are and how they work.<br> 
The human eye can only capture a minuscule portion of the energy travelling across<br>
 the universe in the form of electromagnetic waves and other types of radiation. <br>
 That tiny range of perception, known as the visible spectrum, is basically what <br>
 we call colours.<br><br>

Electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength. What we perceive as purple <br>
travels at a wavelength of about 400 nanometers (nm). Radiation under 400nm is known<br>
as “ultraviolet” and is invisible to humans. Another type of radiation, “ionising radiation”,<br>
 also travels at a wavelength below 400nm. This radiation transforms the atoms it touches <br>
 into ions by stealing their electrons and breaking the chemical bonds of molecules. In short,<br>
  it is unstable and dangerous for humans. For instance, radioactive materials like uranium <br>
  release ionising radiation – which, in extreme amounts, can cause burns and even death.<br>

The panic about electromagnetic radiation started in the 1950s. In the aftermath of World War II,<br>
 an epidemic of so-called “radio wave sickness” struck military outposts in Eastern Europe. <br>
 People said radios and radars were causing symptoms like fatigue, headaches, vertigo and trouble<br> 
 sleeping. Today, the condition is known as electromagnetic hypersensitivity, but it’s not recognised<br>
  as a disease by medical authorities and is mostly self-diagnosed.<br><br>

In 1979, electromagnetic waves began to be associated with cancer. It all started with a scientific<br>
 article which observed that in Colorado, high voltage lines were more often found near the homes <br>
 of children who developed cancer compared with healthy kids. The correlation was researched in many<br>
  subsequent studies, but to this day, no consistent evidence to corroborate the claim has been found.<br><br>

In the 1980s, when microwaves became a common household appliance, public fear of electromagnetic radiation<br>
 spiked, fuelled by the media. Microwaves were said to cause cancer and destroy the nutrients in food. Although<br>
current studies show that a microwave in good condition poses no health risk to humans, false reports about <br>
the Soviet Union banning microwaves in 1976 keep popping up every now and again.<br><br>

Health organisations such as the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety say <br>
there’s a “possible” link between electromagnetic radiation and cancer, especially leukaemia in children. <br>
That’s because early studies found some correlation, despite the WHO calling the evidence “weak” and their <br>
methodology being called into question.<br>

As for the long-term effects of electromagnetic radiation, in 2011 the International Agency for Research on <br>
Cancer classified electromagnetic radiation as  “possibly carcinogenic”, but with a huge caveat. They found <br>
“limited” evidence connecting the use of mobiles with two specific types of cancer, glioma and acoustic neuroma<br>
, and “inadequate” evidence for other types. Other common substances like pickles and coffee are also considered<br>
 possibly carcinogenic by the WHO.<br><br>

Scientific basis for the panic is shaky at best, but that hasn’t stopped people freaking out about<br>
electromagnetic waves. But if scientists can’t know something for sure, non-scientists won’t be able to figure <br>
it out either. Technophobia, or fear of technology, might just be deeply rooted in the human psyche.<br><br>

How Britain Fell for the 5G Conspiracy Theory<br>
MARIA POPE<br>
04.29.20<br><br>

Ian Hacking, a Canadian philosopher of science, studied the phenomenon of “temporary mental illnesses”, or disorders that <br>
only appear within certain contexts and then disappear. For example, in 16th century Europe, around the time transparent <br>
glass became common, people were convinced their own bodies had become glass. This “glass delusion” affected even <br>
King Charles VI of France, who dressed in special reinforced clothing to protect his fragile body. Another famously <br>
technophobic group was the Luddites – English textile workers who destroyed their weaving machines in the 19th century <br>
in protest against the domination of technology.<br><br>

Today, the invisible waves that connect us to each other are being seen as a similar threat. And with Big Tech using waves<br>
to collect more and more of our personal data, people are losing trust and heading down conspiracy rabbit holes. 5G is just<br>
 the latest scapegoat.<br> </p>
