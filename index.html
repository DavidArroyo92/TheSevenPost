        <p>
            The 5G rollout has been far from smooth. Despite its dazzling promises, like 
            the advent of self-driving cars and virtual reality, the fifth generation of 
            mobile internet is considered a threat by many. On the 14th of July of this 
            year, the UK <a href="#">banned 5G kits </a>produced by Chinese manufacturer Huawei due 
            to security concerns. Meanwhile, activists are taking issue <a href="#">with the 
            environmental cost </a> of the new technology, which will require enormous 
            resources just to replace the already-speedy 4G network.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Then, there’s a group of people who oppose 5G because they believe it's a 
            health hazard. The theory that mobile phones cause cancer has been around
            for a while, albeit with <a href="#">little scientific basis</a>. In its latest iteration,
            <a href="#">conspiracy theorists</a> say 5G phone towers are weakening our immune systems and
            increasing our vulnerability to <a href="#">COVID-19</a>. Some even believe the towers
            transmit the virus directly to humans – and that naturally the best way to
            fight the pandemic is to <a href="#">set them</a> on fire.

            This fear of waves might feel very bat-shit 2020, but the phenomenon has been
            around for at least 60 years. Electromagnetic waves, high-voltage lines, 
            microwaves, radios, radars, wind turbines and wifi modems: all have been “blamed”
            for causing health problems such as leukaemia, infertility and autism. None of 
            these theories have been scientifically confirmed, but a mix of miscommunication,
            poor understanding of science and sheer mysticism has kept them alive.
            </p>

            <p>
            First of all, it’s important to understand what “waves” are and how they work.
            The human eye can only capture a <a href="#">minuscule portion</a> of the energy travelling across
            the universe in the form of electromagnetic waves and other types of radiation.
            That tiny range of perception, known as the visible spectrum, is basically what
            we call colours.
            </p>
            <p>
            Electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength. What we perceive as purple
            travels at a wavelength of about 400 nanometers (nm). Radiation under 400nm is
            known as “ultraviolet” and is invisible to humans. Another type of radiation,
            “ionising radiation”, also travels at a wavelength below 400nm. This radiation
            transforms the atoms it touches into ions by stealing their electrons and
            breaking the chemical bonds of molecules. In short, it is unstable and dangerous
            for humans. For instance, radioactive materials like uranium release ionising 
            radiation – which, in extreme amounts, can cause burns and even death.
            </p>
            <p>
            The panic about electromagnetic radiation started in the 1950s. In the aftermath
            of World War II, an epidemic of so-called “radio wave sickness” struck military
            outposts in Eastern Europe. People said radios and radars were causing symptoms
            like fatigue, headaches, vertigo and trouble sleeping. Today, the condition is
            known as <a href="#">electromagnetic hypersensitivity</a>, but it’s not recognised as a disease
            by medical authorities and is mostly <a href="#">self-diagnosed.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            In 1979, electromagnetic waves began to be associated with cancer. It all started
            with a <a href="#">scientific article</a> which observed that in Colorado, high voltage lines 
            were more often found near the homes of children who developed cancer compared with
            healthy kids. The correlation was researched in many subsequent studies, but to 
            this day, <a href="#">no consistent evidence</a> to corroborate the claim has been found.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the 1980s, when microwaves became a common household appliance, public fear
            of electromagnetic radiation spiked, fuelled by <a href="#">the media</a>. Microwaves were said
            to <a href="#">cause cancer</a> and <a href="#">destroy the nutrients</a> in food. Although current studies show
            that a microwave in good condition poses <a href="#">no health risk</a> to humans, <a href="#">false reports</a>
            about the Soviet Union banning microwaves in 1976 keep popping up every now and
            again.<br><br>

            Health organisations such as the French Agency for Food, Environmental and
            Occupational Health and Safety say there’s a “possible” link between electromagnetic
            radiation and cancer, especially leukaemia in children. That’s because early studies
            found some correlation, despite the WHO calling the evidence “weak” and <a href="#">their
            methodology</a> being called into question.
            </p>
            <p>
            As for the long-term effects of electromagnetic radiation, in 2011 the International
            Agency for Research on Cancer classified electromagnetic radiation as 
            <a href="#">“possibly carcinogenic”</a>, but with a huge caveat. They found “limited” evidence 
            connecting the use of mobiles with two specific types of cancer, glioma and acoustic
            neuroma, and “inadequate” evidence for other types. Other common substances like 
            <a href="#">pickles and coffee</a> are also considered <a href="#">possibly carcinogenic</a> by the WHO.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Scientific basis for the panic is shaky at best, but that hasn’t stopped people
            freaking out about electromagnetic waves. But if scientists can’t know something
            for sure, non-scientists won’t be able to figure it out either. Technophobia, or
            fear of technology, might just be deeply rooted in the human psyche.

            <a href="#">Ian Hacking</a>, a Canadian philosopher of science, studied the phenomenon of “temporary 
            mental illnesses”, or disorders that only appear within certain contexts and then
            disappear. For example, in 16th century Europe, around the time transparent glass became
            common, <a href="#">people were convinced</a> their own bodies had become glass. This “glass delusion”
            affected even King Charles VI of France, who dressed in special reinforced clothing to
            protect his fragile body. Another famously technophobic group was the Luddites – 
            English textile workers who destroyed their weaving machines in the 19th century in 
            protest against the domination of technology.

            Today, the invisible waves that connect us to each other are being seen as a similar
